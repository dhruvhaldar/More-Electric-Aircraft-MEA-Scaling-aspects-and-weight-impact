abstract = {The importance of the more electric aircraft has been highlighted in many publications, projects and industrial presentations. By definition, the more electric aircraft concept achieves the majority of the required system functionality by using electrically powered sub-systems and components. This manifests itself in much higher electrical power demands on-board aircraft, compared to conventional architectures. This presents many challenges in the design process. To alleviate the risk and choose the optimum architectures for the systems on the aircraft, it is essential to incorporate the characteristics and possible configurations of the electrical network in the conceptual and preliminary design stages. Hence the current practice of performing an electrical load analysis at the detailed design stage is not adequate. To address this gap, this paper presents a viable and robust methodology to define requirements, size components and systems and calculates the electric power requirements at the preliminary design stages. The methodology uses the conventional aircraft, systems and components as the baseline and uses mathematical techniques and logical sequences of component operation, developed through the research, to size electrical load profiles for conventional aircraft. It then adapts this result to the more electric aircraft concept by adding key components that would account for the difference between a conventional system and a more electric system. The methodology presented here makes the design process more robust and aids the choice of the optimum design for the aircraft.},

The three main tasks of the ECS are to pressurise and ventilate the cabin and to control its temperature. As the ECS is one of the largest power consumer among the non-propulsive systems, it appears clear that toward a More Electrical Aircraft, the electrification of this system will play a key role within the power generation and management and fuel saving, but will also have a big impact on other systems using pneumatic power, for example the Wing Ice Protection System. This paper describes the main changes, benefits and drawbacks linked to the electrification of the ECS: the deletion of engine bleed air system and the increased needs in electrical power, the positive fuel consumption impact on the engine and increased ECS weight.},

abstract = {This paper discusses engineering aspects of a modern commercial jet airliner environmental control system (ECS), focusing on cabin air quality. Recent national news media coverage suggests that aircraft cabin air quality is a serious concern. However, an objective review of pertinent data and recent comprehensive testing do not support this perception. Even more important than "air quality" is "survivability." Because modern jet airplanes operate in a physical environment that is not survivable by unprotected humans, these airplanes contain a complex ECS. Such systems enable survival, safety, and comfort. Aerospace medical experts are highly cognizant of this fact. ECS engineers study requirements for maintaining human physiological integrity, provided by the aerospace medical community. These requirements are converted into components for environmental control and life support systems. Data from studies of human comfort factors are also applied to the design of these systems. The following discussion reviews the major components of the ECS that sustains human life and comfort during flight. To illustrate how the ECS works, a volume of air will be followed as it flows continuously from outside the airplane into the airplane cabin and, finally, exits the airplane. The initial conditions and subsequent changes to this volume of air as it travels through each component of the ECS system during various flight phases will be discussed. Figure 1 is a schematic of the ECS components for the Boeing 767 airplane. The 767 is a modern generation airplane that uses 50{\%} filtered recirculated air and 50{\%} outside air. This is typical of modern generation airplanes.

abstract = {In this paper the performance of the gas turbine engines of a commercial passenger aircraft is evaluated for both bleed air off-take and electric power off-take. As these types of engine power off-takes are not directly comparable, an exergy analysis is used to establish the most efficient type of off-take. From this analysis appears that it is indeed more efficient to bleed air from the engine instead of generating the equivalent amount of exergy in terms of electric power. However, when also taking into account the performance of the largest pneumatic power consumer, the Environmental Control System (ECS) it appears that about 2{\%} thrust specific fuel consumption can be saved, by using a More-Electric ECS instead of a conventional bleed air powered ECS.},

abstract = {The classical approach to trajectory optimisation uses aircraft dynamics models coupled with engine performance models to optimise for different objectives such as fuel, time, noise and emissions. However, initial studies have shown that airframe systems loads and the resulting fuel penalties due to off-takes, is influenced and more importantly influences the optimum trajectories. Moreover, the need for such an enhanced approach is required to define the "more electric aircraft trajectory optimisation" problem. This paper describes the methodology which has been used to represent the airframe systems operation and the subsequent penalties in the trajectory optimisation studies conducted within the GATAC framework, under the Systems for Green Operation (SGO) work package in the Clean Sky programme. The purpose of the integrated airframe systems model is to model and interface the airframe systems power requirements or "secondary power" requirements within the optimisation framework and other models involved in the optimisation. The integrated model accumulates the requirements for the individual models and then computes the total bleed air mass flow and shaft power off-take requirements from the aircraft engine. In the case of the more electric aircraft, the off-takes are limited to shaft power offtakes since the bleed air is eliminated. This paper presents a modelling methodology which focuses on modelling airframe systems based on the power requirements with regard to design and certification standards. Also considered is computational efficiency such that the models can be incorporated in exhaustive trajectory optimisation problems without causing significant performance penalties. Preliminary trajectory optimisation results confirm that the inclusion of airframe systems influences the trajectory optimisation, especially when trajectories are optimised for minimum fuel burn. The significance is such that the penalties due to systems have to be accounted for when aircraft trajectory optimisation is studied for environmental gains. The combined effect and the enhanced approach to optimisation progresses the prediction of optimum flight trajectories for real aircraft.},

abstract = {The aerospace industry is currently transitioning to More Electric subsystem architectures due to steadily improving electric technologies and the technology saturation of established conventional architectures. For aircraft with such unconventional architectures, the lack of historical information and the presence of increased inter-subsystem interactions create a significant design challenge. These necessitate a greater focus on subsystems design earlier in the design process than typically seen for aircraft with conventional subsystem architectures. At the same time, however, to be suitable for the early design phases, the subsystem analyses must be computationally inexpensive and not require detailed aircraft definition. This work presents an integrated, modular, and tool-independent approach to the sizing and performance analysis of the aircraft and its subsystems, in which inter-dependencies are established between relevant aircraft and subsystem level parameters. The approach allows the assessment of subsystem architectures using vehicle and mission level metrics for a fixed vehicle design, and also the amplified effect of re-sizing the vehicle in accordance with a pre-defined rule-set. The proposed approach was demonstrated through a comparative assessment of a predominantly electric subsystem architecture and a conventional one for a representative single-aisle aircraft. In this assessment, the impacts of changing the form of secondary power extraction, the change in vehicle empty weight, and re-sizing of the vehicle were successively identified.},

Cabin humidification is realized through the injection of purified water into the suction side of cabin environmental control system compressor without changing the original system structure. Another advantage of the new system is the lower demand of ram air benefitted from the decreased temperature of compressor inlet with water injection process. System analysis models and software using enthalpy parameter method are also presented. Verification experiments focused on the core parts of the integrated system show that the system analysis models agree with the experimental data well. System performance characteristic and fuel penalty are evaluated using thermodynamic analysis parameters. Results show that under 5 g/(kg{\textperiodcentered}dry air) humidification, the cabin humidity increased smoothly to about 27.9{\%} during the cruising state. The fuel penalty decreased by 1{\%} under the new integrated system for the lower demand of ram air. The novel integrated system is effective and economy.},

abstract = {Current industry trends demonstrate aircraft electrification will be part of future platforms in order to achieve higher levels of efficiency in various vehicle level sub-systems. However, electrification requires a substantial change in aircraft design that is not suitable for re-winged or re-engined applications as some aircraft manufacturers are opting for today. Thermal limits arise as engine cores progressively get smaller and hotter to improve overall engine efficiency, while legacy systems still demand a substantial amount of pneumatic, hydraulic and electric power extraction. The environmental control system (ECS) provides pressurization, ventilation and air conditioning in commercial aircraft, making it the main heat sink for all aircraft loads with exception of the engine fuel thermal management system. To mitigate the architecture thermal limits in an efficient manner, the form in which the ECS integrates with the engine will have to be enhanced as to reduce the overall energy consumed and achieve an energy optimized solution. This study examines a tradeoff analysis of an electric ECS by use of a fully integrated Numerical Propulsion Simulation System (NPSS) model that is capable of studying the interaction between the ECS and the engine cycle deck. It was found that an improved solution lays in a hybrid ECS where it utilizes the correct balance between a traditional pneumatic and a fully electric system. This intermediate architecture offers a substantial improvement in aircraft fuel consumptions due to a reduced amount of waste heat and customer bleed in exchange for partial electrification of the air-conditions pack which is a viable option for re-winged applications.},

The former includes the consumed hydrogen and electrical energy, and the latter includes the sum of the battery, fuel-cell, and electric-motor costs. Three methods with different levels of modelling details are investigated; in the first method, the power split between the two power sources together with component sizes are optimized, while assuming nonlinear loss functions for the components. In the second method, the efficiencies of the components are approximated by constant values. In the third method, the problem is simplified further by considering the energy split between the battery and the fuel-cell. As shown in the results, a more detailed model gives more accurate results at the price of increased computation time. However, the simplified models can give similar results as the detailed model in most cases.

It uses optimization to simultaneously solve design problems with several disciplines involved. In order to predict aircraft performance an engine performance simulation model, also called “rubber engine”, is vital. The goal of this project is to validate and integrate a rubber engine model into an MDO environment. A method for computer simulation of gas turbine aero engine performance was created. GasTurb v11, a commercial gas turbine performance simulation software, was selected for doing the simulation models. The method was validated by applying it to five different jet engines of different size, different type and different age. It was shown that the simulation engine model results are close to the engine manufacturer data in terms of SFC and net thrust during cruise, maximum climb (MCL) and take off (MTO) thrust ratings. The cruise, take off and climb SFC was in general predicted within 2{\%} error when compared to engine manufacturer performance data. The take off and climb net thrust was in general predicted with less than 5{\%} error. The integration of the rubber engine model with the MDO framework was started and it was demonstrated that the model can run within the MDO software. Four different jet engine models have been prepared for use within the optimization software. The main conclusion is that GasTurb v11 can be used to make accurate jet engine performance simulation models and that it is possible to incorporate these models into an MDO environment. iii},

abstract = {Air traffic simulations serve as common practice to evaluate different concepts and methods for air transportation studies. The aircraft performance model is a key element that supports these simulation-based studies. It is also an important component for simulation-independent studies, such as air traffic optimization and prediction studies. Commonly, contemporary studies have to rely on proprietary aircraft performance models that restrict the redistribution of the data and code. To promote openness and research comparability, an alternative open performance model would be beneficial for the air transportation research community. In this paper, we introduce an open aircraft performance model (OpenAP). It is an open-source model that is based on a number of our previous studies, which were focused on different components of the aircraft performance. The unique characteristic of OpenAP is that it was built upon open aircraft surveillance data and open literature models. The model is composed of four main components, including aircraft and engine properties, kinematic performances, dynamic performances, and utility libraries. Alongside the performance model, we are publishing an open-source toolkit to facilitate the use of this model. The main objective of this paper is to describe each main component, their connections, and how they can be used for simulation and research in practice. Finally, we analyzed the performance of OpenAP by comparing it with an existing performance model and sample flight data.},

Drag may be estimated thousands of times during a multidisciplinary design optimization, and computational fluid dynamics is not yet possible in these studies. The current model has been developed as part of an air-vehicle conceptual-design multidisciplinary design optimization framework. Its use for subsonic and transonic aircraft configurations is presented and validated. We present our parametric geometry definition, followed by the drag model description. The drag model includes induced, friction, wave, and interference drag. The model is compared with subsonic and transonic isolated wings, and a wing/body configuration used previously in drag prediction workshops. The agreement between the predictions of the drag model and test data is good, but lessens at high lift coefficients and high transonic Mach numbers. In some cases the accuracy of this drag estimation method exceeds much more elaborate analyses. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010.},

There is then a short account  of the use of vectored thrust and a final chapter on transonic and supersonic flight. The emphasis is on  deriving and applying simple analytical expressions rather than on computations from extensive numerical data, but all the exemplary calculations refer to current types of aircraft and the few necessary data are provided. The greater part of the book refers to subsonic aircraft flying at subcritical speeds, which can be dealt with using relatively simple equations, but it is shown that some of this simplicity can be carried over to transonic and supersonic speeds.

abstract = {generation icing simulation technology must be synchronous with general advances in CFD, accurate, upgradeable and capable of handling complex three-dimensional geometries. While undoubtedly aircraft and engine icing analysis can be complex, nothing approaches the complexities of helicopter icing in terms of geometries, attitudes, propeller/rotor interaction, engine intakes (side entrance, front entrance), etc. In addition, a number of unmanned aerial vehicles are currently in development worldwide with wide-ranging size, payload, and mission profile as well as command and control capabilities. Due to their lower cruising altitudes and smaller excess power margins, propeller-driven unmanned aerial vehicles are particularly vulnerable to in-flight icing. Even high-altitude cruising turbine-powered UAVs can be exposed to icing conditions for long periods because their relatively low climb rates require longer times to cross critical icing altitudes. Lessons learned from Operation Allied Force in Bosnia (and from the engagement in Afghanistan) include unforeseen mid-level icing encounters, which caused heated pitot tubes to freeze and therefore sent the UAV computer erroneous flight information [1]. This confirms the well-known fact that besides performance degradation due to loss of lift, drag and weight increase and change of handling qualities; in-flight icing can affect performance of an aerial system in a number of ways. To minimize probability of hull loss of UAVs due to icing, several recent designs have incorporated active ice protection such as freezing point depressants, electrothermal or electro-expulsive systems. In order to improve predictions of droplet impingement characteristics and ice growth on rotorcraft or tiltrotor fuselage, wing, tail and air induction system, an actuator disk model was implemented in the finite-element flow solver FENSAP, part of the FENSAP-ICE aerodynamics and icing simulation system. The paper will present results of flow, droplet impingement and ice accretion on a complete helicopter, including main and tail rotors in hover and forward flight, and the BA 609 tiltrotor aircraft in airplane mode. All rotating components will be modeled as actuator disks. 2 Computational Approach FENSAP-ICE (Refs. 3-7) is a second generation icing simulation system comprised of a suite of modules designed for the complete prediction of icing over a component or for integrated system performance in an icing environment. For this paper, the FENSAP flow calculation module is used for the initial aerodynamic calculation. FENSAP is a second-order accurate finite-element Navier-Stokes solver. FENSAP accommodates hexahedral and tetrahedral meshes, as well as hybrid grids comprised of both with the possibility to include transition elements such as prisms and pyramids. DROP3D is the Eulerian droplet impingement module used to compute collection efficiency distribution on 3-D complex bodies. DROP3D is based on partial differential equations for droplet concentration and momentum, completely eliminating particle tracking as in the traditional Lagrangian approach. ICE3D is the 3-D ice growth calculation module, again based on partial differential equations on the body surface, as opposed to a 1-D control volume approach in the streamwise direction typically in use today. The advantage of the PDE approach is that it eliminates the need to start calculation at stagnation points, which in 3-D may be complex attachment lines, and to march along successive control volumes on a 1-D surface streamline as the mass and energy conservation equations are solved on all wall surfaces for both streamwise and cross-flow directions, simultaneously. CHT3D is the conjugate heat transfer interface used to solve for convective heat transfer inside and outside a component, along with the conduction through the solid medium. It is used for hot air ice protection systems design and analysis. Surfaces deformed by ice accretion are remeshed automatically via Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) moving grid method in FENSAP. Finally, the OptiMesh anisotropic},

@techreport{Dalili2009,
abstract = {Wind turbine performance can be significantly reduced when the surface integrity of the turbine blades is compromised. Many frontier high-energy regions that are sought for wind farm development including Nordic, warm-humid, and desert-like environments often provide conditions detrimental to the surface of the turbine blade. In Nordic climates ice can form on the blades and the turbine structure itself through a variety of mechanisms. Initial ice adhesion may slightly modify the original aerodynamic profile of the blade; continued ice accretion can drastically affect the structural loading of the entire rotor leading to potentially dangerous situations. In warmer climates, a humid wind is desirable for its increased density; however, it can come at a price when the region supports large populations of insects. Insect collisions with the blades can foul blade surfaces leading to a marked increase in skin drag, reducing power production by as much as 50 percent. Finally, in more arid regions where there is no threat from ice or insects, high winds can carry soil particles eroded from the ground (abrasive particles). Particulate-laden winds effectively sand-blast the blade surfaces, and disrupt the original skin profile of the blade, again reducing its aerodynamic efficiency. While these problems are challenging, some mitigative measures presently exist and are discussed in the paper. Though, many of the current solutions to ice or insect fouling actually siphon power from the turbine itself to operate, or require that the turbine be stopped, in either case, profitability is diminished. Our survey of this topic in the course of our research suggests that a desirable solution may be a single surface engineered coating that reduces the incidence of ice adhesion, insect fouling, and protects the blade surface from erosive deterioration. Research directions that may lead to such a development are discussed herein. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Zhang1994,
abstract = {A standard $\kappa$-$\epsilon${lunate} model is used to simmulate the turbulent recirculating flows over a backward facing step, a forward facing step and a single block. The advection terms are discretized by the upwind weighted difference scheme, the pressure problem is resolved by the artificial compressibility method. The results show that the $\kappa$-$\epsilon${lunate} model can give a good prediction for the mean velocities and the static pressure field. The turbulent kinetic energy is underpredicted. The numerical errors can produce serious deficiencies in the predictions. The structure of turbulent recirculating flows over a backward facing step is different to that over a forward facing step. Finally, the model is applied to the flow over a surface-mounted cube placed in a turbulent boundary layer. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

It advocates that computational economy, range of appii$\sim$b$\sim$ity and physical realism are best served at present by turbulence models in which the magnitudes of two turbulence quantities, the turbulence kinetic energy k and its dissipation rate e, are calculated from transport equations solved simultaneously with those governing the mean flow behaviour.

@article{Menter1994,
abstract = {Two new two-equation eddy-viscosity turbulence models will be presented. They combine different elements of existing models that are considered superior to their alternatives. The first model, referred to as the baseline (BSL) model, utilizes the original k-$\omega$ model of Wilcox in the inner region of the boundary layer and switches to the standard k-$\omega$ model in the outer region and in free shear flows. It has a performance similar to the Wilcox model, but avoids that model's strong freestream sensitivity. The second model results from a modification to the definition of the eddy-viscosity in the BSL model, which accounts for the effect of the transport of the principal turbulent shear stress. The new model is called the shear-stress transport-model and leads to major improvements in the prediction of adverse pressure gradient flows. {\textcopyright} 1994 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., All rights reserved.},

@article{shinlaw1,
abstract = {With the increasing demand of air travel, the impact on the environment due to aviation has shown a significant increase in recent times. As a result, there is a growing demand for new technologies and flight procedures that will enable aircraft operators to burn less fuel and reduce the adverse effect of aviation on the environment. Conventional approaches to trajectory optimisation do not take the effect of aircraft systems into account. Neglecting these effects may be inadequate, especially when one considers real aircraft operations in real weather scenarios. This research has developed a tool capable of simulating aircraft ice protection performance for trajectory optimisation, which enables the development of a decision making process dependent on weather within the flight management system, thus transforming the conventional ice protection system to a more intelligent system. Presently, thermal ice protection methods are the leading ice protection technology on most of the medium and large transport aircraft. An enhanced aircraft anti-icing model was developed based on Messinger mass and energy balance method for thermal anti-icing. The tool developed in this work can calculate the total water catch and evaluate power requirement due to icing under a wide range of meteorological conditions. The model was successfully integrated with a trajectory optimisation framework for independent assessment of fuel penalty due to icing and investigation of pollutant emissions reduction through aircraft trajectory optimisation. A case of typical departure from London Airport Heathrow was optimised for fuel burn and time. The preliminary results show that when operating in known icing condition, including icing parameters in the optimisation loop could give as much as 2.1% fuel savings.},

abstract = {XFOIL is an interactive program for the design and analysis of subsonic isolated airfoils. It consists of a collection of menu-driven routines which perform various useful functions such as: - Viscous (or inviscid) analysis of an existing airfoil, allowing * forced or free transition * transitional separation bubble(s) * limited trailing edge separation * lift and drag predictions just beyond CLmax * Karman-Tsien compressibility correction - Airfoil design and redesign by interactive specification of a surface speed distribution via screen cursor or mouse. Two such facilities are implemented. * Full-Inverse, based on a complex-mapping formulation * Mixed-Inverse, an extension of XFOIL's basic panel method Full-inverse allows multi-point design, while Mixed-inverse allows relatively strict geometry control over parts of the airfoil. - Airfoil redesign by interactive specification of new geometric parameters such as * new max thickness and/or camber * new LE radius * new TE thickness * new camber line via geometry specification * new camber line via loading change specification * flap deflection * explicit contour geometry (via screen cursor) - Blending of airfoils - Drag polar calculation with fixed or varying Reynolds and/or Mach numbers. - Writing and reading of airfoil geometry and polar save files - Plotting of geometry, pressure distributions, and polars (Versaplot-derivative plot package used)},
